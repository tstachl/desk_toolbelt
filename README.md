# Desk.com Toolbelt ([desktoolbelt.heroku.com](https://desktoolbelt.heroku.com))

Desk.com Toolbelt is a data management suit for Desk.com. It allows you to export data from your Desk.com environment into multiple output formats like JSON and XML.

Also you don't have to export all your data and filter it afterwards, we filter your data beforehand and you only export what you really want or need. Our search and filter criteria are very extensive eg. you can search for all cases of a specific customer or only cases that have been created in the last week.

## Branch structure

There are two main branches to this repository, *master* and *develop*, these make it easier to use the same repository for developing. All development occurs in the develop branch. We are using feature branches to add develop features which are merged back into develop and once proven and stable will be merged into the master branch.

## Issues

Please refer to the *issues* section of this repository if you stumble upon any bugs or possible bugs. But keep in mind to search for a similar issue before posting.

## Wiki

At some point we might use the wiki section for tutorials but at the moment this is not on the roadmap.
