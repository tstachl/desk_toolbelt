You'll also notice a blank text box below this comment. That is for you to respond. Let's do that:\n\n        1. Write: \"Thanks for this information, please tell me more.\"\n        2. Change the drop-down field labeled Status to \"Pending\"\n        3. Click the submit button in the lower right.\n\n        If you follow these instructions, you'll get an email response back from us shortly.

We are going to go through the basic support ticket operation in Zendesk.\n\n    If you are in your email reading this, please click on the link in the header that starts with Ticket #.\n\n    When you clicked submit, an email was generated and sent to your customer. When they reply to that email, it will automatically update here in the ticket like this.\n\n    One thing to point out is that the Status field now says \"open\". This automatically changed when the customer (in this case, me!) responded. When a ticket is pending it means that you are waiting for more information and so you don't need to be thinking about it right now. Open tickets are the ones that require your attention. Because the customer responded, the ticket needs your attention again, so it's automatically 'opened'.\n\n    Now let's solve the ticket:\n\n    1. Change status to 'solved'\n    2. Write something like \"Hope this resolves your issue, please let me know if you need anything else.\"\n\n    Click submit again.",

          "subject": "Am I required to have travel insurance?",
          "main_content": "<p>Yes, you are now required to have travel insurance on all of our trips.</p>\r\n<p><br />Surfing is inherently dangerous and some of the locations that we travel to have limited medical resources. Most people think they are covered if they already have existing health care insurance. Within the United States, that&amp;rsquo;s true. Outside the U.S., however, is a big IF.</p>\r\n<p><br />And in many cases, even if you are covered for basic emergency care overseas (again, a big IF), in almost all cases, your current health insurance does NOT cover you to evacuate you and repatriate you back to the U.S. This is where Medical Evacuation and Repatriation insurance comes into play. I believe this is essential for anyone who travels. It's an insurance program (usually an annual premium, not often purchased per trip) where if you get sick or injured overseas the policy will get you treated, stabilized and flown back to the U.S. There are a number of good companies that provide this plan, two of which are Travel Guard and Medjet Assist. The annual premium is about $300, and it's the card you hope you never have to use. My Advice: YES, get this, with another important caveat: read the fine print. With Travel Guard and Medjet assist, these policies provide that they will get you initially treated and stabilized and then send a medically equipped and staffed jet to fly you to the doctor and medical facility of your choice. This is crucial. Outside of Travel Guard and Medjet assist, many other companies that offer this insurance will fly you to the doctor and medical facility of their choice.</p>\r\n<p><br />And then there's another reason for getting this coverage: If you're in a foreign country, particularly a developing country, many hospitals will admit you without caring about coverage, but they won't let you leave until you pay. Travel insurance can help facilitate payment, and act as an advocate so that you're not overcharged because you're an American.</p>",
